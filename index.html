            <p>Hello! My name is Tiara Mota and I am from Ceara, Brazil. I served a mission Juiz de Fora / Brazil.
                I had a brilliant opportunity to know better Christ and incredible people there. I learned to be a
                better person and overcome my own limits, with the help of Christ's atonement. I'm a creative person, I'm
                adaptable and like to work like a team. I have experience like a team leader, I'm punctual,
                organized, proactive and love learn. I give my best in all things that I do. I'm graduate in
                System Analysis in Brazil. I found myself in technology area and love it, so I decide to study on
                BYU to learn more and in the future be a specialist in development. Currently I work with genealogy, in
                an office of international advocacy to help other people conquering your foreign citizenship. 
                I'm graduate too in Physical Education, because my first love was sports, especially adventure
                sports, love reading about topics that help to be better and know me to help others, about 
                technology and finance, I love travel and to be with my family.</p>
